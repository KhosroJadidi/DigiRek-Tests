## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project satisfies the requirements of the backend part of the test project, which has been published by "digi-rek.se" here:

https://github.com/DigiRek/Tests

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Simply run the project with your IDE or text editor of choice. VisualStudio 2019 is recommended. If you use VisualStudio Code, you might need to add some additional assets to the project to build it. If that happens to be the case, VisualStudio Code will prompt and ask you about this.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have .Net Core 5.0 or higher installed on your machine.

<h4>.Net Core 5.0 (Download)</h4>
<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

<h4>In VisualStudio 2019:</h4>
Go to Test->Test Explorer.<br>
You can choose to run the available tests individually or all at once.

<h4>In VisualStudio Code:</h4>
Open a Terminal->New Terminal to open a new terminal window.
Navigate to the test folder by using the "cd" command.<br>
cd [directory name] will move you one level deeper.<br>
cd ..\ will move you one level up.<br>
Once in the tests directory, use the following command to run all tests:


```
dotnet test
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Upon running the code, a console message will provide you with the instruction that you need.
Please follow the on-screen instructions to performe your desired function.
Some classes in the codebase contain several functions that produce the same output (such as addition). This isn't a practical solution, but has been left in the code to demonstrate my ability to tackle a problem from different angels.You may "swap" these funtions in and out, by commneting and uncommenting them.

## ❓ Some Explanation <a name="som-explanation"></a>

<h4>Why are there so many public functions?</h4>
I usually make most of my functions private. However, this test required me to have as many of them tested as possible. 
Since the testing library has been located in a separate project, I had to make my functions public to be able to test them.

<h4>Why haven't you tested some of the functions?</h4>
A few functions contain already tested smaller functions. 
It didn't feel necessary to test them, since their building blocks had already been tested.

<h4>Why have you used the singleton design pattern in some parts of your code?</h4>
This design pattern has been used to limit certain classes exposure, and guarantee that only one instance of such classes is used throughout the application.
