## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project satisfies the requirements of the backend part of the test project, which has been published by "digi-rek.se" here:

https://github.com/DigiRek/Tests

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Simply run the project with your IDE or text editor of choice. VisualStudio 2019 is recommended. If you use VisualStudio Code, you might need to add some additional assets to the project to build it. If that happens to be the case, VisualStudio Code will prompt and ask you about this.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have .Net Core 5.0 or higher installed on your machine.

<h4>.Net Core 5.0 (Download)</h4>

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Upon running the code, a console message will provide you with the instruction that you need.
Please follow the on-screen instructions to performe your desired function.
Some classes in the codebase contain several functions that produce the same output (such as addition). This isn't a practical solution, but has been left in the code to demonstrate my ability to tackle a problem from different angels.You may "swap" these funtions in and out, by commneting and uncommenting them in the "Run" funtion (located in Program.cs).
